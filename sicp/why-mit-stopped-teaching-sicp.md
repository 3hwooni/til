# Programming by poking: why MIT stopped teaching SICP

> Gerry Sussman was asked why MIT stopped teaching the legendary 6.001 course, which was based on Sussman and Abelson’s classic text [The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/)(SICP).

> they felt that the SICP curriculum no longer prepared engineers for what engineering is like today.

> in the 80s and 90s, engineers built complex systems by combining simple and well-understood parts.
> The goal of SICP was to provide the abstraction language for reasoning about such systems.

> Sussman pointed out that engineers now routinely write code for complicated hardware that they don’t fully understand.

> You grab this piece of library and you poke at it. You write programs that poke it and see what it does.

> The “analysis-by-synthesis” view of SICP — where you build a larger system out of smaller, simple parts — became irrelevant. Nowadays, we do programming by poking.

> Sussman admitted that the SICP curriculum was “more coherent” than what they have now and that they still don’t know what the right curriculum should be.
